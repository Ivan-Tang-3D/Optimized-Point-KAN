# Point-KAN
KAN-based Point Models(PointNeXt/PointMAE/Point Transformer) Performance Test and Optimization.
Due to the surge in popularity of KAN, we plan to incorporate KAN into point cloud-related models for evaluation. We will integrate KAN into familiar point cloud model architectures such as Point-MAE, Point Transformer, and PointNeXt to enhance interpretability and performance. Stay tuned to see what challenges we encounter and how we effectively improve them!
